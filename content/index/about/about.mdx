I am currently a Junior Data Scientist at Arthena, a VC-backed startup that provides institutional 
investors exposure to the art market using quantitative and fundamental research.

I graduated from The University of Chicago in 2020 with a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics, and B.A. in Economics with a Specialization in Data Science.
